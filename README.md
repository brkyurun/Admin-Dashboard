# Admin Dashboard

Another super fun project I had the chance to do thanks to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It took me longer than the [Sign-up Form Project](https://github.com/brkyurun/sign-up-form), but in a way, it was even more exciting to build this dashboard. I would definitely say this project greatly improved my understanding and knowledge of CSS Grid.

## Resources Used

During the project, I have referred to the resources below for building the UI:

- Tailwind CSS color palette for designing a color theme: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- MDI for SVG icons used in the UI: [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- Boring Avatars by [Hayk An](https://hayk.design/#/) and [Josep Martins](https://www.josepmartins.com/) for the profile photos: [Boring Avatars](https://boringavatars.com/)

## Features

- Built using pure HTML5 and vanilla CSS3.
- Built with eye-comfort and accessibility in mind.
- Soft, minimal design language to enable the user to just focus on the content.
- Transition effects on the sidebar links, the search bar, dashboard button group, the icons inside the article cards, and user tags in trending card.
